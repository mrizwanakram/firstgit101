1 - Which of th following is characteristic of best 
    machine learning method?
	[A]. Predictive B. Causal C. Mechanistics D. All of the mentioned

2 - The input image has been converted into a matrix of size 28 X 28 
    and a kernel/filter of size 7 X 7 with a stride of 1. 
    What will be the size of the convoluted matrix?
	A. 20x20 B. 21x21 [C]. 22x22 D. 25x25

3 - In CNN, having max pooling always decrease the parameters?
	A. True [B]. False C. Can be True & False D. Can not say

4 - What is loss function or objective function in deep learning?
	[A]. To control the output of a neural network, you need 
           to be able to measure how far this output is from what you expected
	B. To calculate loss in banks 
 	C. These are true targets of data
	D. These are the predicted values only

5 - The loss function takes the predictions of the network and 
    the true target (what you wanted the network to output) and 
    computes a distance score, capturing how well the network has done
	[A]. True B. False 

6 - SVM stands for?

	[B]. Deep neural networks and kernel functions 
	C. Support Vector Machines and loss functions 
	D. None of the above 	

8 - Overfit model? 
	[A]. A model that learns the training dataset too well, 
	   on the training dataset but does not perform well
	   on a testing dataset
	B. A model that fails to sufficiently learn the problem
	   and performs poorly on a training dataset and does not 
	   peerform well on a testing dataset
	C. All of above
	D. None of above

9 - Which of the following statement(s) correctly represents a real neuron?
	A. A neuron has a single input and a single output only
	B. A neuron has multiple inputs but a single output only
	C. A neuron has a single input but multiple outputs
	D. A neuron has multiple inputs and multiple outputs
	[E]. All of the above statements are valid

10- Which of the following gives non-linearity to a neural network?
	A. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
	[B]. Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
